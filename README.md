**Extract Restaurant Data Using Google Maps Data Scraping with python**
## steps of my work
**1. Install and Import libraries<br/>**
**2. Get a googlemaps Object<br/>**
**3. Get place Id<br/>**
**4. Get Reviews<br/>**
**5. Place_name<br/>**
**6. Rating<br/>**
**7. Number_of_reviews<br/>**
**8. latitude<br/>**
**9. longitude<br/>**
**10. Price<br/>**
**11. Export to csv file<br/>**

**I have also included the output file which is "restaurant.csv"<br/>**
**I was able to extract data for a restaurant, but due to the "Api key's"  time limit, I was unable to complete the work.<br/>**
